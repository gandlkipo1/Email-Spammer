# Email-Spammer

This is the email spammer/ mass sender I created to send out mass emails witho NO SMTP required.


# Usage

download the two files, and put email list in emails.txt file, after this run main.py and select one of the two options, either 1 or 2. If you selected 1 type in the email you want to spam and the number of emails you want to send. If you selected option 2 it should guide you through the steps of using it.
